# a3-map-cfgpatches-to-mod-and-mod-id
This script is designed to scan Arma 3 `.pbo` files within a mods directory, extract `CfgPatches` entries, and map them to the corresponding Steam Workshop mod ID and name. The results are saved in an SQF array format, making it easy to search for `CfgPatches` entries and find the associated mod name and ID.
